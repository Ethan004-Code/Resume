Hello there! I’m Ethan, a passionate learner currently pursuing my Data Science degree at San Jose State University. I'm driven by the challenge of building real-world solutions that combine data, design and meaningful impact. Through hands-on projects like development, machine learning, and data analysis, I uncover insights from data and communicate them through compelling storytelling. I use a variety of tools to clean and analyze datasets, ensuring clarity and depth in the findings.

Beyond academics, I'm deeply curious and enjoy sharing and learning different ideas. I am always looking for ways to grow and collaborate. If you're interested in working on a project or simply having a passionate conversation about tech, health or other shared interests,please, feel free to reach out - I'm always open to learning from others and building something together.
